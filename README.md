# Pok√©dex Tech Test

Greetings, Trainer! üëã

Professor Oak needs your help to complete his Pok√©dex.
He‚Äôs entrusted you with a Coreloops codebase, but it‚Äôs missing some key features.
Your mission is to extend the project, refine it, and prove your skills as a true full-stack Pok√©mon Master.

---

## Getting Started
### Initial Setup
1. Install dependencies:

    ```
    pnpm install
   ```

2. Run the following command to get the database started:

    ```
    docker compose up -d
    ```

3. Run the following command to migrate the database:

    ```
    pnpm run migrate:local
    ```

4. Run the following command to seed the initial data:

    ```
    pnpm run seed:local
    ```

5. Run the following command to start the server

    ```
    pnpm run serve:dev
    ```

6. Run the following command to start the frontend:

    ```
    pnpm run serve:web
   ```

### Tooling
Our database definitions live in `libs/data-access-layer`. In here we use Drizzle to handle our migrations. When you add a new table to the database, you must run the command `pnpm run barrels` to generate barrel files
and they will be auto imported into the schema. You them also need to add the new files into the `drizzle.config.ts` file.

We have a `libs/shared-types` package that houses our data models, separated by View / Post. Whenever a new file is added in here, you can run the same `pnpm run barrels` command and it will auto generate the barrel files
and you can then import the types into whichever project requires them.

To generate and perform a migration you can use `pnpm run migrate:local`.

## Tasks

Your goal is to complete as many of the following tasks as possible within 3 hours. Don‚Äôt worry if you don‚Äôt finish them all ‚Äì we want to see your approach, thought process, and code quality more than a perfectly finished product.
1. Create new database tables
   - Add a table for moves (there is already a seed file located at `libs/data-access-layer/orm/seed/seed-moves.ts`)
   - Add a join table for pokemon_moves (so Pok√©mon can learn many moves) (there is already a seed file located at `libs/data-access-layer/orm/seed/seed-pokemon-moves.ts`)
   - Add the seed files to the `libs/data-access-layer/orm/seed/seed.ts` script and insert into the database.
2. Pok√©mon detail modal
   - On the home page, each Pok√©mon card has a ‚ÄúView‚Äù button.
   - When clicked, a modal should appear showing:
     - The Pok√©mon‚Äôs details
     - All the moves it can learn, in a table format
     - The table must:
       - Be sortable by level and move power
       - Default sort: level ascending
3. Refactor Home Page
   - Improve the code structure and readability of the home page.
   - Apply React best practices for state management, hooks, and component composition.
4. Admin-only delete
   - Admin users can delete Pok√©mon from the database.
   - Non-admin users should not see the delete button at all.
   - Extend the users table with a new column:
```
is_admin boolean DEFAULT false
```

5. Polish
   - Anything else you can do to improve UX, code clarity, or consistency is a bonus.

Timebox
‚Ä¢	You have 3 hours to work on this.
‚Ä¢	Get as far as you can ‚Äì partial progress is fine, we‚Äôll review your approach.

Submitting Your Work
1. Clone or fork this repository.
2. Complete the tasks in your fork.
3. Push your finished work to a new GitHub repository and include a fresh readme. The readme should contain the following:
   - A brief description of the changes you've made and why you made them (if applicable)
   - Whether or not AI was used, and for what (using AI is OK, we just want to know how/if you use it)
   - What was challenging about the task, skip this if everything was all good!
4. Email the repo link to:
   - stephen@coreloops.ai
   - gabriel@coreloops.ai
5. Deadline: Thursday 5pm (UK time)

Hints from the Professor
‚Ä¢	Use Drizzle ORM migrations for schema changes.
‚Ä¢	The UI is powered with Next.js, React, and shadcn/ui components.
‚Ä¢	Keep your changes modular ‚Äì imagine the Pok√©dex will grow with many new features.
‚Ä¢	Bonus points for clean commits, type safety, and solid React patterns.

---

Example Feature Flow
1.	Add moves + pokemon_moves tables.
2.	Update seed data / controllers to expose moves.
3.	On Pok√©mon card ‚Üí View ‚Üí open modal ‚Üí show table of moves.
4.	Sort the table by clicking headers. (maybe tanstack table??)
5.	Add is_admin to users ‚Üí show delete button only if true.
