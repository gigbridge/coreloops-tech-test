# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for completing the Pokédex Tech Test, which involves extending an existing full-stack application with new database tables, UI components, and admin functionality. The project uses NestJS for the backend API, Next.js for the frontend, Drizzle ORM for database management, and PostgreSQL as the database. The goal is to enhance the Pokédex application with move management, detailed Pokémon views, improved code structure, and admin-only features within a 3-hour timeframe.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Database Schema Enhancement

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create new database tables for moves and pokemon-moves relationships, so that Pokémon can be associated with their learnable moves.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating the moves table THEN the system SHALL include columns for id, name, accuracy, damageClass, power, pp, and typeId
2. WHEN creating the pokemon_moves join table THEN the system SHALL include columns for pokemonId, moveId, and level
3. WHEN running migrations THEN the system SHALL successfully create both tables with proper foreign key relationships
4. WHEN seeding the database THEN the system SHALL populate both tables with the provided seed data
5. WHEN generating barrel files THEN the system SHALL automatically include the new schema files in exports

### Requirement 2: Pokémon Detail Modal

**User Story:** As a user, I want to view detailed information about a Pokémon including its moves in a modal, so that I can see comprehensive data without navigating away from the main page.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking the "View" button on a Pokémon card THEN the system SHALL open a modal displaying Pokémon details
2. WHEN the modal opens THEN the system SHALL display all moves the Pokémon can learn in a table format
3. WHEN viewing the moves table THEN the system SHALL allow sorting by level and move power
4. WHEN the moves table loads THEN the system SHALL default to sorting by level in ascending order
5. WHEN clicking table headers THEN the system SHALL toggle between ascending and descending sort order
6. WHEN the modal is open THEN the system SHALL provide a way to close it and return to the main view

### Requirement 3: Home Page Refactoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to improve the code structure and readability of the home page, so that it follows React best practices and is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring the home page THEN the system SHALL implement proper component composition
2. WHEN managing state THEN the system SHALL use appropriate React hooks and patterns
3. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL separate concerns into logical components
4. WHEN implementing functionality THEN the system SHALL follow React best practices for performance
5. WHEN reviewing the code THEN the system SHALL demonstrate improved readability and maintainability

### Requirement 4: Admin-Only Delete Functionality

**User Story:** As an admin user, I want to delete Pokémon from the database, so that I can manage the Pokédex content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN extending the users table THEN the system SHALL add an is_admin boolean column with default false
2. WHEN a user is an admin THEN the system SHALL display delete buttons on Pokémon cards
3. WHEN a user is not an admin THEN the system SHALL NOT display delete buttons at all
4. WHEN an admin clicks delete THEN the system SHALL remove the Pokémon from the database
5. WHEN deleting a Pokémon THEN the system SHALL handle the operation securely with proper authorization
6. WHEN the delete operation completes THEN the system SHALL update the UI to reflect the change

### Requirement 5: User Experience Polish

**User Story:** As a user, I want an improved and consistent user experience, so that the application is pleasant and intuitive to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN interacting with the application THEN the system SHALL provide consistent visual feedback
2. WHEN performing actions THEN the system SHALL display appropriate loading states
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL show user-friendly error messages
4. WHEN using the interface THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive design across devices
5. WHEN navigating the application THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transitions and interactions
